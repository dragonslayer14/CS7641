- Project code in folder `P3-UL`
- elbow method code adapted from from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elbow-method-for-optimal-value-of-k-in-kmeans/
- Requirements were pip frozen to requirements.txt
- `python main.py` // update as needed
    - run all algorithms for all problems
    - creates fitness vs problem size chart, stored in the charts folder, by the name of the problem which
    contains all algos for comparison
    - ANN comparison step generates a chart named ann_compare.png and outputs fit times to the console for the table
