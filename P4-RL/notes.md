## OH 10

- should do small and big within each problem
- care about exploration strategy
- should be discrete, continuous would make your life harder
- should still talk about why they are interesting and why they are different, one grid world one not grid world
- comparing convergence and time behaviors
- exploration strategy is key, compare with VI PI
- if you are not converging, you may not be visiting all states, see why that is the case
- visualize the policies, will make it easier
- ok to do things like reward shaping
  - certain environments may be too difficult
- analysis of convergence plot
  - delta convergence where optimal is known value and the convergence towards that is tracked
